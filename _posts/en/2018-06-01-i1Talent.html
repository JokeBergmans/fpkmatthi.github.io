            The 2 types that stuck out the most were seller and perfectionist.
            According to the legend, these 2 types mean the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5>Seller</h5>
                <p>
                    The seller is someone who likes to score. He/she is an oppertunist and competitive.
                    Hereby, he/she can seem confident or arrogant. The sellers knows how to get things done.
                    He/she will only make the necessary efforts to achieve the desired result.
                    According to the enneagram, the seller is driven by deceit.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5>Perfectionist</h5>
                <p>
                    The perfectionist has a lot of attention to detail.
                    He/she likes to stick to the rules and feels responsible.
                    In the eyes of others, the perfectionist can sound stubborn.
                    He/she also has troubles with delegating tasks.
                    According to the enneagram, the perfectionist is driven by rage.
                    This results in passion and demandingness.

        <h5>Conclusion: INTJ(Introversion, Intuition, Thinking, Judging)</h5>
        <p>
            From all 16 types, INTJ is the most independant one.
            It's always on the lookout for new angles of approach, has a sharp mind and is quick of understanding.
            INTJ types tend to have a lot of confidence and do not care too much about others.
            They are at their best during activities or jobs where they can peacefully develop their ideas.
