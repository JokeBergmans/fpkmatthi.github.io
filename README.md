[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpkmatthi/fpkmatthi.github.io.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/fpkmatthi/fpkmatthi.github.io)

My portfolio/blog started out as an assignment for the course i1Talent.  
The first generation was a from-scratch website, hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/f19502fb910e) and made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and some ES6.

Now I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with unsupported plugins and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to build and maintain my portfolio, hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
